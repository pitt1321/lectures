# READING for Physics 1321 (Fall 2016)

Textbook is "Computational Physics" by Mark Newman.  This book is referred to as "CP"  below.
Additional resources will be listed.  These will include many online tutorials.  Please watch and read these materials -- it will save valuable class time. 
As a general rule you will find yourself doing much more reading in the first month and much more timing designing and coding in the subsequent months.
